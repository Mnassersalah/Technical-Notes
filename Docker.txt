	- 

- Containers Vs Virtual machines 
	- Containers : virtualize only the apps layer(file system, ..) of os but uses the kernal of the hosting os.
	- VM : virtualize both the kernal & apps layers of OS so it's heavier than container.

Docker : 
	- Containers management service
	- it's not the only tool to manage containers it has competitors like , 
	
Container : 
	- runnable unit of software that packaging up code with its dependancies, configurations ...
	- runnable instance of an image.
	
Image : 
	- Read-only template with instructions for creating a docker container.
	- a template for how to build a container.
	
Rejestry : 
	Stores docker images.
	- eg, DockerHub is a public rejestries that anyone can use.
			it's the default rejestry for Docker so 
				ie, if we run pull command it look for images in the local machine if not found it will look for it on Docker Hub by default (can be configured).
