Proxy 
A proxy is simply a middleman for communication (requests + responses). Client <-> Proxy <-> Server

Forward Proxy (Client proxy): 
	- ( client <-> proxy ) <-> server
		The proxy acts on behalf of the client. The client knows about all three machines involved in the chain. The server doesn't.
		ie, hide the client from distination.
	
	uses : 
		- Caching 
		- logging 
		- anonymaty
		- website blocking
		- microservices

Reverse Proxy (Server proxy)
	- client <-> ( proxy <-> server )
		The proxy acts on behalf of the server. The client only knows about the proxy. The server knows the whole chain.
		ie, hide distination from client.
		
	uses : 
		- load balancing 
		- ingress (routing eg, /products to server1, /users => server2)
		- canary deployment (deploying a release to subset of users)
		- Caching
		- microservices
