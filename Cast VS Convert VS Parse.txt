
cast vs convert vs parse
cast & convert has the same syntax " (type1)type2 " but they'er different : 
= cast : change the type without changing value () >> from parent to child 
= convert : changing the value from type to type >> using casting operator

= parsing : is used with converting from string >> converting string to different type by understanding its content.
