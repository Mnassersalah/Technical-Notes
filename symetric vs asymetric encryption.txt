== symetric encryption
- one shared key used for encrypting & decrypting
	so if the two ends has that key they could ( encrypt >> send >> decrypt ) safely
	
- Pros 
	- Fast 
	- Efficient for large files 

- Cons
	- hard to send shared key safely

- eg : 
	AES (advanced encryption standard)
	DES (less secure)
	Twofish
	Serpent

== asymetric encryption
- public key for encrypting
- private key for decrypting
	- sending public key from A to B
	- B use that key to encrypt data then send it to A
	- A use private key to decrypt the data.

- Pros 
	- public key can be shared 
	- designed for small data (ssh)

- Cons 
	- slow (time consuming algorithm to encrypt and decrypt)
	- ineffecient for large files.
	
- eg : 
	RSA (used in SSH), 
	Diffie-Hellman , 
	ElGamal
